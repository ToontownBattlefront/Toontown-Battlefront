This is where Concept Artist should upload their work. 
Developers need to check this page DAILY for updates. Developers will have a page soon.

--- Concept 1 ---
- Make tunnels to streets ask: Would you like to join the (street name(Walrus Way)) Battle? Yes? No?
= If no, make screen back to normal and let walk around again.
= If yes, begin loading Battle... Say: "Searching for 80% full battles." and go down from there searching for battles.
 = Just like Star Wars Battlefront
 
 [Overview] Basically we need to unload cogs off of all streets, building doors need to open automatically when near
           (we only need a few), streets need to be expanded a little bit(I can explain which way we need to),
           Unload Fishing, All NPC's, Cut off access to other playgrounds from the street, Make buildings able to go in without
           loading when the door opens automatically. 
 [More] I will have more details soon on what each street will have, such as the battle types.
